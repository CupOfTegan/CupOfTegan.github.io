      <description>Sometimes you have low days. Days that it is hard to get out of bed, let alone leave the house.
For me, these days are usually paired with pajamas and mild anxiety of what is outside my door, and the guilt of failing to be a &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; human being. It is the sort of day where I will just plunge into a computer game as it means I have to make very little in the way of real life decisions.</description>
